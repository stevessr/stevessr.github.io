Console displaying all Ruler traits after not specifying one for a Ruler
If you want to contribute to this page, which is a work in progress, in the console type "help" to see the list of commands, then to see a description and parameter of a command, type "help [command-name]", and put the corresponding details into the list.

This page deals with commands used in the console. For the modding term, see effects.
This page lists the codes which may be input into the console window, a special debugging window which may be accessed on non-ironman games by pressing Shift+2, ALT+2+1, Shift+3,§, ~, ^, °, 2, or ` (key varies based on keyboard layout). For a QWERTY keyboard, the key is `. Else, try pressing Shift + Alt + C if none of the above worked. Press the up or down arrow keys to traverse through previously executed commands. Many codes can be turned off by repeating the command, but sometimes reloading the save or exiting the game is necessary.

IDs
Most IDs are predefined and can be found on the ID page. Species, leader, empire and pop IDs however are defined when the game is created and have to be found with the debugtooltip command.

Species IDs can be read by hovering over a species in the species menu. If a modded starting system was not used the player's species will always be 0 for the main species and 1 for the syncretic/cyborg/bio-trophy/prepatent species.
Leader IDs can be read by hovering over a leader in the leaders or empire menus. If a modded starting system was not used the player's starting leaders will always be 0 (ruler), 1 (governor) and 2-4 (scientists).
Empire IDs can be read by hovering over an empire's flag in the contacts menu or its borders on the galaxy map. If a modded starting system was not used the player's empire will always be 0.
Ship IDs can be read by hovering over a ship in the fleet window. If a modded starting system was not used the player's starting science ship will always be 0.
Pop IDs can be read by hovering over a pop in the population tab.
Cheats

TweakerGUI commands
TweakerGUI commands are a specific sub-set of commands that spawn UI elements for toggling of commands preventing the need for re-opening the console and typing out the command again.
All commands in this sub-set 'must' start with tweakergui.
Warning: Closing TweakerGUI crashes the game as of 3.2.

Changing galactic imperium color
The color of the galactic empire can be changed mid-game while playing as the galactic emperor by copying the following command combination into the console and replacing the color name: effect = { change_country_flag = { icon = { category = "special" file = "the_empire.dds" } background= { category = "backgrounds" file = "00_solid.dds" } colors={ "red" "red" "null" "null" } } }

The word red can be replaced by any color name to give a different color, such as dark_blue
